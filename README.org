* Philosophy
The convertion should never lose information. That is guaranteed by
the fact that

: [%madcast: t2 -> t1] [%madcast: t1 -> t2] (x : t1)

must always return =x=, except when =[%madcast: t1 -> t2]= (that is, the
first cast applied to =x=) raises an exception.

* Installation
** Dependencies
   - opam-installer
   - ppxfind
   ... and others
